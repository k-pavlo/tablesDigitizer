This is a sample text file for testing the CLI!

You can use this to test the 'analyze' command:
    python cli.py analyze sample.txt

Claude will read this file and tell you what it thinks about it.

Try creating your own files and analyzing them:
- Python scripts (.py)
- Text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
- Any other text-based files!

Have fun building your hackathon project!
